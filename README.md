# Tiny Discord

Basic components for interacting with the Discord API with zero dependencies.

The goal of this project is to offer a basic platform for building high-efficiency bots and libraries in NodeJS. Its core components are plug and play standalone files fully written with core NodeJS modules without a single third-party dependency.

Tests and contributions are welcome.
